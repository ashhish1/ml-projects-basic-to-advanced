Description:
Feature selection helps identify the most relevant features for a model by eliminating irrelevant, redundant, or noisy data. This improves model performance, interpretability, and reduces overfitting. In this project, we demonstrate multiple common feature selection techniques on the Iris dataset.

Python Implementation:
# Import required libraries
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif, RFE
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import pandas as pd
 
# Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target
feature_names = iris.feature_names
 
# Convert to DataFrame for clarity
df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=feature_names)
df["target"] = y
 
# ---- 1. Univariate Selection (ANOVA F-test) ----
selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=2)
X_new = selector.fit_transform(X, y)
selected_features_univariate = [feature_names[i] for i in selector.get_support(indices=True)]
 
print("Top 2 Features (Univariate Selection - ANOVA F-test):")
print(selected_features_univariate)
 
# ---- 2. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) ----
rfe_model = RFE(estimator=LogisticRegression(max_iter=200), n_features_to_select=2)
rfe_model.fit(X, y)
selected_features_rfe = [feature_names[i] for i in range(len(feature_names)) if rfe_model.support_[i]]
 
print("\nTop 2 Features (Recursive Feature Elimination):")
print(selected_features_rfe)
 
# ---- 3. Feature Importance from Random Forest ----
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X, y)
feature_importances = rf_model.feature_importances_
 
# Rank and select top 2
importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Feature": feature_names,
    "Importance": feature_importances
}).sort_values(by="Importance", ascending=False)
 
print("\nFeature Importances (Random Forest):")
print(importance_df)
 
# Display top 2
top_features_rf = importance_df["Feature"].values[:2]
print("\nTop 2 Features (Random Forest Importance):")
print(top_features_rf)
🔍 Techniques Demonstrated:
Univariate Selection (ANOVA F-test) – Select features individually based on statistical tests.

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) – Recursively removes less important features.

Tree-Based Feature Importance – Uses models like Random Forest to rank features.

These techniques can be combined with cross-validation, or used with other datasets like customer churn or credit scoring.
